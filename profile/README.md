## Hi there 👋

Here is A Mathematical Team in Modeling.

🙋‍♀️ We take part in CUMCM2020, CUMCM2021 and MCM2022, and we have achieved great results!

👩‍💻 We love teamwork, we work together to solve mathematical problems through modeling.

🧙 We keep our code private because we're afraid about the disclosure of our privacy.

🍿 However, **we will share our LaTeX template some day in the future**, at that time you can use it for your own modeling work.

🌈 If you have anything problem about solving mathematical problems through modeling, you can contact me through my e-mail: fentaniao@gmail.com, I'm glad to talk with you.
